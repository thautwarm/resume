\role{Intern}{Compiler Design, Distributed System, Machine Learning Framework}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Created \href{https://github.com/Microsoft/GraphEngine/tree/master/src/Modules/GraphEngine.Storage.Composite} {an implementation} of dynamically loading and updating distributed data schema for Microsoft GraphEngine
  \item Created prototypes for MSRA internal projects about future machine learning frameworks, including gluing Python with MySQL in runtime level, and an extended SQL
  \item Created \href{https://github.com/thautwarm/LLAST} {a LLVM IR builder framework} in .NET side, which is introduced into a future/extended version of GraphEngine to achieve JIT support
  \item Finished a part of lowering tasks for the first/basic language in the platform of that future/extended version of GraphEngine
\end{itemize}

\section{\faGithubAlt\ Personal Projects}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{YAPyPy}}{\url{https://github.com/Xython/YAPyPy}}
Yet Another Python Python / Pure Python Compiler
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item A pure Python compiler built on CPython, which provides full compatibility for multiple versions of CPython 3.x
%       , currently support 3.6.x and 3.7.x
%   \item Provided some syntax extensions like dictionary destructuring and pattern matching
%   \item Capable of customizing parser and bytecode emitter
%       , which enables making arbitrary syntactic/semantic extensions with CPython its own
% \end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{MLStyle.jl}}{\url{https://thautwarm.github.io/MLStyle.jl/latest/}}
A Julia package that provides ML language infrastructures like extensible pattern matching, ADTs/GADTs, etc.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Support a large number of patterns from other languages like Haskell, Elixir, F\#, OCaml, etc.
%   \item Provided a group of concise, intuitive and convenient interfaces to customize pattern matching(extensible pattern matching)
%   \item Allow users to restrict the accessing of patterns via a customizable predicate in module level 
%         , to achieve a clean scoping and avoid conflicts against redefinitions of custom patterns
%   \item Provided a homoiconic way to manipulation ASTs via pattern matching 
%         , which enables users to extract sub-patterns from given ASTs and rewrite them, without a prerequisite
%   about Julia ASTs
% \end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{FSTan}}{\url{https://github.com/thautwarm/FSTan}}
F\# implementation of Lightweighted Higher Kined Types and type classes
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Provided a set of commonly-used abstractions like Functor, Monad, MonadTrans, etc., and some commonly-used data types like State/StateT, Either/EitherT, etc.
%  \item Support ad-hoc polymorphisms(via F\#'s STRT), which is an advance comparing to other implementaions
%  \item Support separating data type definitions from interfacing/instancing type classes , which is an advance comparing to other implementaions
% \end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{RSolve}}{\url{https://github.com/thautwarm/RSolve}}
A general purposed solver for logic programming in Haskell
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Established an abstraction over unification algorithms, which could be applied to many concrete instances(introduced below)
%  \item Provided some concrete instances like HM unification and option question puzzles
%  \item No dependency but Haskell standard libraries
% \end{itemize}
